# Pet Adoption Agency  

This repository contains a project developed for my **SOEN287 course**. It is a **Pet Adoption Agency** platform where users can browse pets available for adoption and list their own pets for adoption. The application includes an account feature with **user sessions**, ensuring that certain functionalities are only accessible to registered and logged-in users. Additionally, it features static pages with supplementary information.  

## Features  

- **User Authentication:**  
  Users must create an account and log in to access key features like listing pets for adoption.  
- **Dynamic Content Rendering:**  
  Utilized **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)** templates to dynamically render content with integrated JavaScript logic directly in the HTML.  
- **Session Management:**  
  Implemented user sessions to track login states. A "Logout" button is displayed only when a user is logged in.  
- **Responsive Design:**  
  Styled using **CSS** to ensure an intuitive and visually appealing user experience across devices.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Node.js** with **Express.js** for backend development  
- **EJS** for dynamic server-side rendering  
- **CSS** for styling  
- **JavaScript** for interactive front-end behavior
