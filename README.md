This project was created for my SOEN287 course. It is a pet adoption agency where you can find and put pets up for adoption. An account feature was created with user sessions so that you must be registered and logged in to use some of these features. There are some static pages as well to see other, less relevant information.

This project was created using NodeJS with ExpressJS, CSS, JavaScript and EJS (instead of HTML) which helped with adding code statements directly into the file. That allowed me to easily add user sessions which followed whether a user was signed in or not and when signed in, a logout button would only stay on the screen until the user session ended.

Feel free to clone the repository and check it out for yourself! To run the server, make sure to have Node installed as well as typing in the command "npm install" in the terminal in the server directory. Type "node server.js" for the server to run and go to "localhost:6724" to access the website.
